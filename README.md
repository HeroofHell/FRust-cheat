- this source includes the following :
-> d2d hijacking technique that hijacks Nivida Overlay.
-> A read/write memory class including reading Strings (not the best way of reading strings but it should work fine.)
-> Uses smart pointers instead of managing memory manually
-> that's it!

I may update this in the future if requested Enjoy!
